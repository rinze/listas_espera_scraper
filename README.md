This code doesn't work for some reason, but I have opened a question in 
StackOverflow just in case someone can tell me what's missing (or, if you are 
reading this and know it, just sent me your patch and I'll be happy to 
incorporate it). The question [is 
here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/16606/scraping-aspx-form-with-pythons-mechanize).
